<summary><b>Jordan:</b></summary>
<p> Looking back to the start of this project and seeing what the finished product looks like, it‚Äôs an incredible feeling to see what we accomplished as a team. We took on a new language (TypeScript) and incorporated it within a React app.
The setup of the app using TypeScript proved to be a huge challenge for us. Setting up the data types that were incoming, the data types our functions were outputting, and everything in-between was a huge learning curve. There were lots of errors to work around, frustrations with learning the new language, and wins as we solved these issues to get our app up and running, however we all came out with a better understanding of how a React app should flow, and how TypeScript is implemented to define our data types.</p>

<p> I'm so proud with the end result of our application. It was fun to let our creative direction drive this project. During this project, I learned Typescript, Hooks, and how to create an Express server simultaneously. With the help of my competent group, I gained a deeper understanding of some new core topics I'll rely on in my future. The biggest blocker in our project proved to be stubbing the data for our Cypress tests. Although, I did deepen my understanding on this concept as well. We were very meticulous. Overall,  I'm pleased with my learning experience and I will definitely refer back to this project for reference.</p>

<p> During Module 3 we were tasked with learning a new language and best practices for implementing it. The group and I chose TypeScript due to it‚Äôs popular use in real world applications and it‚Äôs purpose of ensuring longevity as well as error handling. Along the way we added a few more tricks to our arsenal (Express and Hooks). We found the nuances of TypeScript a little challenging at first but the satisfaction of implementation and confidence in ensuring future extensions would be successful outweighed all other conflicts. In the end, I am proud to deploy MoodTunes for public use and happy to say I built a closer bond with some of my cohort mates.</p>

<summary><b>Michael:</b></summary>
<p>At the beginning of this project, we signed up to learn Typescript and implement it and it's best practices throughout our react project. Starting off, it was difficult to add Typescript changes without breaking the code, and learning when and where to use Types was complicated. However, after further practice, we managed to make TypeScript work, as well as implement React Hooks and use functional componenets in the project. Looking back, I am very proud of the work accomplished here, especially in the short alotted time to learn and implement two big changes my skillset. Going forward, I look forward to using Typescript in my future applications. </p>
